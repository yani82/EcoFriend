## About

This App allows you to source out various eco-friendly and eco-conscious brands that encapsulate retailers from green products to a compost drop-off near you. You can see a list of what you're looking for based on a category of interest, and you are able to comment on the brand, making it easy to share your love for the environment with others.

### Logging In
On the main page, you must sign up or log in to add eco-friendly brands. You are able to see other users' brands and comments without logging in. Once you have logged in, you will be directed to your user page, which will display the brands you're interested in, and allow you to add more brands. 

---

### New Visit
Once you log in, you can add brands you are interested in by clicking on the "Add a Brand" link in the navigation bar. You must enter a comment for every brand. You may add a brand by selecting from one that has already been created or creating a new brand. A new brand will not be saved if you do not include a comment.

---

### Home
The home link will bring you back to the main page that you saw before logging in. It displays all of the users and the brands they have commented on.
